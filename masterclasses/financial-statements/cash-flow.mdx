## Overview

Cash flow forecasts are essential parts of a robust financial model. While the P&L and balance sheet pull directly from your accounting system’s general ledger, the cash flow statement in Francis is created separately. This guide outlines six steps for setting up your cash flow statement using the indirect method.

## Basics

The purpose of the cash flow statement is to bridge profit and cash, track liquidity, and break down where cash is coming from and where it’s going.

Cash is an asset line item on the balance sheet. When we talk about “forecasting cash flow,” we’re ultimately referring to forecasting this specific line item.

We use the cash flow statement for that. The cash flow statement provides a detailed summary of changes in the “cash” line item, both for actuals and forecasts, based on movements in the P&L and balance sheet.

The “cash” line item is mapped to the corresponding GL account, so for actuals, we have a source of truth for the company’s cash position.

In Francis, the cash flow statement uses the _indirect method_. For each month, it starts with the opening cash balance from the asset line item and then applies set-up formulas to add or subtract cash flows from operating, financing, and investing activities to estimate the ending cash balance.

Go through these six steps to set up your cash flow statement:

### **Calculations**

Because the indirect method uses information from the income statement and balance sheet to determine cash flows, all cash flow items in Francis are calculated rows. Calculated rows share these traits:

- They maintain formula consistency over time, applying the same logic each month.
- They don’t include directly imported actuals. Instead, values are derived from other rows.

### **Cash flow categories**

Organize your cash flow statement into three main categories:

- **Operating activities:**Start with net income and adjust for non-cash items like depreciation.
- **Financing activities:**Capture all inflows and outflows related to debt, equity, and other financing sources.
- **Investing activities:**Record cash movements related to acquiring or disposing of long-term assets. Remember to exclude accumulated depreciation since it’s a non-cash item.

### P&L and balance sheet

Because the cash flow statement relies on P&L and balance sheet movements, ensure these statements are properly structured and mapped first. Once set up, you’ll have the foundation you need to accurately model your cash flow.

### Cash and retained earnings

Cash and retained earnings are key links between the financial statements. Treat them carefully when creating your forecast, as they ensure that all three statements remain connected.

### Forecasting

To forecast cash flows, you must forecast your P&L and balance sheet items. This often involves more detailed modeling for balance sheet items than for P&L items. Refer to our [forecasting methods](/masterclasses/forecasting/methods) for guidance, particularly around fixed assumptions and referencing the prior month’s balances.

### Formulas for cash flow categories

The indirect method calculates cash flow movements by referencing P&L and balance sheet changes. When working with balance sheet items, use the difference between this month’s and last month’s values (deltas).

- **Assets:** An increase in assets _reduces_ cash flow (subtract the change).
- **Liabilities and equity:** An increase in liabilities or equity _adds_ to cash flow (add the change).

Include all balance sheet movements (except those related to cash, retained earnings, and accumulated depreciation) in one of your cash flow categories. This ensures your cash flow statement fully reflects the changes in your financial position.
