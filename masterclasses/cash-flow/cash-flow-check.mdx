## Overview

Even if you have set up your cash flow correctly, it may not match in specific periods due to two common reasons:

* Accumulated depreciation

* Retained earnings

These two accounts can create discrepancies in the cash flow statement because, by design, standard cash flow statements usually exclude them. Below, we explain why this mismatch happens and how you can mitigate it.&#x20;

<Tip>
  If you find that your cash flow check is wrong in *every* period, that generally indicates a broader modeling issue rather than a problem with just these two accounts.
</Tip>

## Basics

The cash flow statement captures changes from most balance sheet items, but it does not automatically account for:

* Accumulated depreciation

* Retained earnings

It also doesnâ€™t directly include cash movements on the bank account itself (because calculating those movements is the entire purpose of the cash flow statement).

Therefore, if you record a transaction that affects any of the excluded accounts - along with a corresponding transaction on a typical balance sheet account - only half of the transaction will register in the cash flow statement. This omission causes the estimated cash flow to be incorrect.

If your cash flow check shows discrepancies for specific periods, but you believe your setup is fundamentally correct, follow these three steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check retained earnings and accumulated depreciation">
    Review these line items for extraordinary or unusual transactions. Confirm whether these transactions should indeed be recognized outside the cash flow statement.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Identify the corresponding entries">
    Find the double entry (or offsetting transactions) linked to retained earnings or accumulated depreciation. Ensure that all parts of the transaction are accounted for in the cash flow statement where appropriate.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Manually adjust">
    Insert a manual adjustment line in your cash flow statement to compensate for the missing portion. Document the reason for this manual entry so that future reviewers (including you) understand why it was made.
  </Step>
