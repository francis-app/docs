## Overview

The purpose of your balance sheet is measure the company's profitability. You must map your P\&L to general ledger accounts from your accounting system to automatically update with actuals.

## Basics

### P\&L categories

The Francis template includes the classic P\&L categories which can be found in most charts of accounts from accounting systems. That way, we've made it easy to map your general ledger accounts to the template P\&L.&#x20;

The template P\&L includes margins such as gross margin and profit margin. For these formulas, we've used the `ignore_div_zero()` function to just return zero in periods where revenue is equal to zero. We do so to avoid #DIV!/0 errors. In addition, we recommend that you summarize margins by weighted averages in the total column to the right.&#x20;

### Driver-based forecating

Typically, some P\&L items are forecasted using drivers. You can set up drivers in other tabs and have P\&L [forecasts reference those](https://docs.francis.app/documentation/features/modeling/formulas).&#x20;
