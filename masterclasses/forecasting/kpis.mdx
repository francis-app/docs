## Overview

You have full flexibility to create KPIs based on your needs and place them wherever you prefer.

## Basics

You can use calculations to compute KPIs. The strength of calculations lies in their consistencyâ€”formulas remain the same across periods, making them easy to maintain. Additionally, since they are always derived from other rows, they automatically calculate both forecasted and budgeted values.

<Tip>
  We recommend creating KPIs in standard sheets rather than within a separate consolidation system. When using consolidation and templates, formulas in calculations are fixed and cannot be adjusted per instance. By keeping KPIs outside the consolidation system, you gain greater flexibility to tailor formulas to your specific needs.
