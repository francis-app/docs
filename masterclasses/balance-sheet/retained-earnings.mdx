When importing a chart of accounts from Oracle NetSuite, Xero, or QuickBooks Online, Francis currently does not include the Retained Earnings account. Therefore, you will need to manually calculate retained earnings amounts in your balance sheet for entities using these accounting systems.

<Info>
  Including retained earnings for Netsuite, Xero and Quickbooks Online is scheduled for release during 2025. If you have questions about this upcoming feature, feel free to reach out at [support@francis.app](mailto:support@francis.app).
</Info>

You calculate retained earnings by adding net profit (or loss) to the beginning retained earnings balance.

```typescript
// Example
= "Retained earnings"[-1] + "Net profit"[0]
```

If, in addition to connecting to Oracle NetSuite, Xero, or QuickBooks Online, you also convert the numbers to a different currency, the formula must include adjustments to account for currency conversion:

1. **Retained earnings, starting value**: Adjust to reflect the new monthâ€™s closing exchange rate.

2. **Net profit for the month**: Convert from the average exchange rate to the closing exchange rate for the period.

```typescript
// Example
= "Retained earnings"[-1] / "Exchange rate - closing"[-1] * "Exchange rate - closing"[0] 
+ "Net profit"[0] / "Exchange rate - avg"[0] * "Exchange rate - closing"[0]
```
