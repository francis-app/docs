When importing your chart of accounts from Oracle NetSuite, Xero, or QuickBooks Online, Francis does not currently include a Retained Earnings account. Manually calculating retained earnings is therefore necessary in your balance sheet for these entities.

<Info>
  Including retained earnings for Netsuite, Xero and Quickbooks Online is scheduled for release during 2025. If you have questions about this upcoming feature, feel free to reach out at [support@francis.app](mailto:support@francis.app).
</Info>

Retained earnings are calculated by adding net profit (or loss) to the prior period’s retained earnings balance:

```typescript
// Basic example
= "Retained earnings"[-1] + "Net profit"[0]
```

If currency conversion is enabled on your NetSuite, Xero, or Quickbooks connection, the retained earnings formula must account for differences between average and closing exchange rates:

1. **Retained earnings (starting value):** Adjust to the new month’s closing exchange rate.

2. **Net profit (current month):** Convert from the average exchange rate to the closing rate.

```typescript
// Currency conversion example
= "Retained earnings"[-1] / "Exchange rate - closing"[-1] * "Exchange rate - closing"[0] 
+ "Net profit"[0] / "Exchange rate - avg"[0] * "Exchange rate - closing"[0]
```
