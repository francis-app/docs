## Overview

To present a general ledger account on either the asset or liability side based on whether the amount is positive or negative, you can use IF statements in Francis.

<Tip>
  We recommend fixing issues like this “at the source,” which means in your ERP. Consider creating two accounts - one asset and one liability - and moving amounts between them based on the sign. If that’s not feasible, use the solution below.
</Tip>

## Basics

Follow these steps to set up formulas that display amounts correctly under assets and liabilities:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Separate the GL account">
    Move the relevant account “out of your balance sheet” and into a separate sheet. You’ll reference these amounts in step 3.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create an extra row">
    Create an additional row “on the opposite side.” For example, if the original row is under assets, add a corresponding line item under liabilities, and vice versa.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create IF statements">
    For the two rows under assets and liabilities, create IF statements to display values correctly with the appropriate sign. Here are some examples:

    ```typescript
    if("Bank account"[0]>0,"Bank account"[0],0)
    ```

    ```typescript
    if("Bank account"[0]>0,0,-"Bank account"[0])
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Apply to other periods">
    Start from a period far enough back to include all relevant data, and ensure it applies to all future periods.
  </Step>
