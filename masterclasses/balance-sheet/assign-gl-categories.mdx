## Overview

To present a general ledger account on either the asset or liability side based on whether the amount is positive or negative, you can use IF statements in Francis.

<Tip>
  We recommend fixing issues like this “at the source,” which means in your ERP. Consider creating two accounts - one asset and one liability - and moving amounts between them based on the sign. If that’s not feasible, use the solution below.

## Basics

Follow these steps to set up formulas that display amounts correctly under assets and liabilities:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Separate the GL account">
    Temporarily remove the relevant account from your main balance sheet and place it in a separate sheet. This makes it easier to reference its amounts in future steps.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add a row on the opposite side">
    If the original row was under assets, create a corresponding row under liabilities (or vice versa). These two rows will work together to display amounts correctly.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create IF statements">
    Assign values to each row using conditional formulas. For instance:

    ```typescript
    // Asset row: Show positive amounts
    if("Bank account"[0]>0,"Bank account"[0],0)

    // Liability row: Show negative amounts
    if("Bank account"[0]>0,0,-"Bank account"[0])
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Extend to other periods">
    Apply these formulas from a period far enough back to capture all relevant data, and ensure they continue for any future periods you plan to forecast.
  </Step>
