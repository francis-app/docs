## Overview

After connecting and configuring your data sources, the next step is to build a consolidated model. This Masterclass explains how to use consolidation templates to organize your managed instances in Francis, so you can create a reliable, streamlined consolidation process.

## Basics

### Create a model

To consolidate actuals across multiple entities, begin by creating a model in Francis. You can choose to build it from scratch or start with one of our pre-made templates.

* **Starting from a template** is recommended if you’re new to Francis or want a reliable framework for structuring your model. Templates can be edited to suit your specific needs, so you’re not locked into the initial format.

* **Starting from scratch** may suit you if you already have modeling experience or a detailed financial model in Excel or Google Sheets that you want to replicate in Francis. However, most users benefit from starting with a template, as it provides a faster path to a working consolidation set-up.

### Map your general ledger

Once your model is set up, map your general ledger accounts from your connected data sources. Go to **Mappings** in the top-left for an overview of your data sources and their respective ledgers.

During this step, unify your general ledger accounts so that actuals from different entities can be automatically imported and consolidated. The next step is to split these consolidated numbers into separate entities for more detailed forecasting.

### Split your model by entities

After mapping your general ledger accounts into a single unified structure, you now have a consolidated view of all entities. For planning purposes, however, you may want to forecast each entity separately.

To enable forecasting at the entity level, split your consolidated sheet into multiple instances. Hover over the sheet that contains your consolidated actuals, select the three dots (**...**) to open the action menu, then choose **Split by...**. A modal will appear where you can create separate instances, each reflecting the actuals for one of your entities.
