## Overview

By connecting your Visma e-conomic instance to Francis, you can automatically import and consolidate your actuals. Once integrated, Francis makes your chart of accounts accessible via the **Mappings** view in your model. From there, you can map Visma e-conomic accounts to corresponding line items in your financial model for more accurate and consistent reporting.

## Configuration

To set up your Visma e-conomic integration, go to **Settings \> Integrations \> Visma e-conomic**. After enabling, a prompt will appear asking you to confirm the addition of Francis as an application to your Visma e-conomic account. Completing this authorization step ensures that Francis can securely access the necessary data.

### Draft entries (_kassekladder_)

To include draft entries, also know as _kassekladder_ or _kladdeposteringer_, go to **Settings \> Integrations \> Visma e-conomic**, and enable _Include draft entries (kassekladder)_ in the configuration.

Including draft entires allows you to integrate Francis as part of your team's controlling workflows. With drafts included, you can analyze the effects of entries on financial reports before finalizing and closing the books for a specific month.

### Asset range

If your Visma e-conomic chart of accounts does not match the default template, Francis will prompt you to confirm the asset account range. You’ll specify the start and end of this range by adjusting the `asset_range_start` and `asset_range_end` settings. This ensures that Francis accurately interprets your accounts during data import.

<Tip>
  The default asset range for Visma e-conomic is 5000 to 5990. Even if your chart of accounts follows this default, Francis may still prompt you to confirm these settings.
</Tip>

### Retained earnings

If your chart of accounts differs from Visma e-conomic’s default template, you’ll also be prompted to specify your retained earnings account. In most cases, the retained earnings account is 6130 Retained earnings last year.

<Tip>
  Unsure which account is used for retained earnings? In Visma e-conomic, navigate to Regnskab \> Systemkonti \> Årsafslutning to verify your retained earnings configuration.
</Tip>

### Dimensions

Francis automatically detects whether you use dimensions in Visma e-conomic. If you plan to incorporate dimensions into your planning process, you can select which dimension is most relevant. Once configured, this dimension will be available for splits and breakdowns within Francis, giving you deeper insight into your financial data.

<Info>
  Support for dimensions other than department ("Afdelinger") is coming soon. If you have questions about this feature, feel free to reach out at [support@francis.app](mailto:support@francis.app).

### Currency conversion

Visma e-conomic transactions can be automatically converted from their base currency into a target currency. You can use either market exchange rates or custom rates. To enable this feature, open the **Currency Conversion** section of your Visma e-conomic connection settings in Francis and toggle **Enable currency conversion**.

## Adjustments

Francis applies several adjustments to ensure your imported data is presented in a way that aligns with best practices and supports consistent financial analysis.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Number convention">
    Francis interprets your accounts based on a consistent convention:

    - **Positive (\+):** Income (I), Asset (A), Liability (L), and Equity (EQ) accounts
    - **Negative (-):** Expense (EX) accounts

    These adjustments create a uniform standard across all models and data sources, simplifying comparisons and ensuring your reports are easy to understand. As Francis relies on the configured asset range to determine each account’s classification, confirming your asset range settings is critical. Once correctly set, your accounts will reliably follow the positive/negative convention outlined above.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Retained earnings">
    When you close a fiscal year, Visma e-conomic moves retained earnings from a "Retained earnings this year" account to a "Retained earnings from previous years" account. Francis supports this by introducing an additional “Retained earnings this year” account, giving you a clear and accurate picture of your retained earnings over time.

    As noted above, you may need to specify which account represents retained earnings from previous years so that this adjustment is correctly applied in Francis.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Balance sheet">
    Francis presents balance sheet values as accumulated amounts at a specific point in time, rather than as movements over a period. This approach requires an adjustment upon import, ensuring that your balance sheet data aligns with common reporting practices.

    Because of this convention, you’ll typically summarize balance sheet items using **ENDING** or **DELTA** values instead of **SUM**. Doing so accurately reflects the state of your finances at the chosen reporting date.
