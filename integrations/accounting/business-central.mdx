## Overview

By connecting your Business Central instance to Francis, you can seamlessly import and consolidate your actuals. Once integrated, Francis makes your chart of accounts accessible via the **Mappings** view in your model. From there, you can map Business Central accounts to corresponding line items in your financial model, ensuring more accurate and consistent reporting.

## Configuration

### Account categories

To ensure that imported transactions are processed correctly, all general ledger accounts in Business Central must have appropriate account categories assigned. If you have not yet categorized your accounts, or if you need to double-check these settings, go to **Finance > G/L Account Categories > Edit list > Account Category** in Business Central to review and confirm that each account is properly classified.

### Dimensions

Francis automatically detects whether you use dimensions in Business Central. If you intend to incorporate dimensions into your planning, you can designate which dimension is most relevant. Once selected, this dimension will be available for splits and breakdowns within Francis, helping you gain deeper insights into your financial data.

### Currency conversion

Business Central transactions can be automatically converted from their base currency to a target currency using market or custom exchange rates. To enable this feature, open the **Currency Conversion** section of your Business Central connection settings in Francis and toggle **Enable currency conversion**.

## Adjustments

Francis applies several adjustments to ensure that imported data is aligned with best practices and supports clear financial analysis.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Number convention">
    Francis follows a consistent convention for interpreting accounts:

    * **Positive (+):** Income (I), Asset (A), Liability (L), and Equity (EQ)

    * **Negative (-):** Expense (EX)

    This standardization simplifies comparisons and ensures that reports remain straightforward to interpret. Since Francis relies on your asset range configuration to determine each account’s classification, it’s critical to confirm that your asset range settings are correct.

  <Tab title="Retained earnings">
    When you close a fiscal year, Business Central moves retained earnings from a "Retained earnings this year" account to a "Retained earnings from previous years" account. Francis supports this by introducing an additional “Retained earnings this year” account, giving you a clear and accurate picture of your retained earnings over time.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Balance sheet">
    Francis presents balance sheet values as accumulated amounts at a specific point in time, rather than as movements over a period. This approach requires an adjustment upon import to ensure your balance sheet data aligns with common reporting conventions.

    As a result, you will typically summarize balance sheet items using **ENDING** or **DELTA** values instead of **SUM**. This method provides a more accurate snapshot of your financial position at the chosen reporting date.
