  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I connect multiple accounting systems?" defaultOpen={false}>
    Yes, you can easily configure multiple connections from either the same or different accounting systems. These can then subsequently be consolidated through our Mappings feature, allowing you to unify your general ledgers across entities.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I add more connections to my plan?" defaultOpen={false}>
    Depending on your current plan, you can unlock more connections by either upgrading to a different tier or by adding more connections to your existing plan.

    * For users on the Core plan, upgrade to Advanced or Mastery to add more connections.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How often does Francis sync my data?" defaultOpen={false}>
    There is no limit to how frequently you can sync your data in Francis. However, Francis currently does not support scheduled data source syncs, meaning you'll just need to initiate a sync when you want to pull the latest actuals from your connected systems.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does Francis write any data back to my systems?" defaultOpen={false}>
    No. By design, Francis exclusive *reads* data. For this reason, we always recommend to resolve any data issues at the source, e.g. if you encounter errors in your bookkeeping.
