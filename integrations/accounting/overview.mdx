## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I set up a connection?" defaultOpen={false}>
    For in-depth information on how to set up and configure a connection to your accounting system, we suggest reviewing the documentation for that specific integration and following the steps outlined on those pages.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does Francis support dimensional planning?" defaultOpen={false}>
    Users on Advanced and Mastery plans have access to dimensional planning. Francis will automatically detect any available dimensions in your accounting system, allowing you to pick which dimension is relevant for your financial planning.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I connect multiple accounting systems?" defaultOpen={false}>
    Yes, you can easily configure multiple connections from either the same or different accounting systems. These can then subsequently be consolidated through our Mappings feature, allowing you to unify your general ledgers across entities.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I add more connections to my plan?" defaultOpen={false}>
    Depending on your current plan, you can unlock more connections by either upgrading to a different tier or by adding more connections to your existing plan.

    * For users on the Core plan, upgrade to Advanced or Mastery to add more connections.

    * For users on the Advanced plan, upgrade to Mastery and add more connections.

    * For users on the Mastery plan, simply add more connections to your existing plan.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How often does Francis sync my data?" defaultOpen={false}>
    There is no limit to how frequently you can sync your data in Francis. However, Francis currently does not support scheduled data source syncs, meaning you'll just need to initiate a sync when you want to pull the latest actuals from your connected systems.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does Francis write any data back to my systems?" defaultOpen={false}>
    No. By design, Francis exclusively *reads* data. For this reason, we always recommend to resolve any data issues at the source, e.g. if you encounter errors in your bookkeeping.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I synced my data source, but itâ€™s stuck at 0%. What should I do?" defaultOpen={false}>
    Sometimes, during peak hours, data source syncs are queued if many workspaces are syncing at once. While queued, the progress bar will remain at 0%.

If your sync has been stuck in the queue for more than 30 minutes, contact support@francis.app.
