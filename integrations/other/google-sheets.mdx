## Overview

The Google Sheets integration enables you to import data from virtually any business tool into Francis for financial planning. By pairing Google Sheets with third-party integrations, you can connect CRMs, ERPs, data warehouses, or create custom API connections. Use this integration as a flexible option for importing data that is not already supported by Francis’ native accounting or currency integrations.

## Configuration

To set up the Google Sheets integration, go to **Settings > Integrations > Google Sheets** and connect your Google account. Francis will then create a new Google Sheets file called **Francis Data Source** in your Google Drive. Use this template to input your data, and when you sync the connection again, Francis will automatically import any new or updated information.

To share this sheet with team members, update its permissions in Google Sheets or move it from your personal drive to a shared drive.

<Tip>
  When you configure this integration, Francis requests permission to access your Google account. Francis can view, edit, create, and delete *only* the specific Google Drive files it creates. Francis does not request or gain access to any of your other Google Drive files.
</Tip>

### Data formats

Before setting up a Google Sheets connection, you must choose one of two templates — monthly totals or detailed entries — based on how your data is organized. Select the template that best matches your existing format and reporting needs.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Monthly totals">
    Select monthly totals if your data is already aggregated by month and does not require drilling down into individual records. This format is best suited for data that is summarized on a monthly basis.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Detailed entries">
    Select detailed entries if your data consists of individual records or row-level transactions that have not been aggregated into monthly totals. While this template can handle aggregated data, it’s ideal for CSV exports from various tools that require minimal preprocessing. Data imported via this template supports drill-downs in Francis, enabling more detailed analysis and explainability.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Google Sheets for Microsoft users and organizations

If you’re using Microsoft 365, you can still connect Google Sheets to Francis by creating a Google account that uses your Microsoft email address. This approach lets you add a Google Sheets connection to your organization within Francis.

## Importing accounting data

Google Sheets makes it easy to import data from accounting systems that aren’t supported by our native integrations. Follow the steps below to ensure Francis accurately interprets your accounting data and applies the correct transformations.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Format your data">
    After establishing a connection to Google Sheets, start by uploading your data. Since you’re working with accounting data, it’s important to format it correctly to ensure proper transformation once it’s in Francis. Follow these guidelines for consistent results:

    * **Income** accounts: Input negative (-) values.

    * **Expense** accounts: Input positive (+) values.

    * **Asset** accounts: Input positive (+) values.

    * **Liability** accounts: Input negative (-) values.

    * **Equity** accounts: Input negative (-) values.

    Balance sheet accounts (assets, liabilities, and equity) are automatically accumulated at import. To accommodate this, provide **delta values** rather than cumulative totals.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Treat as entity">
    Once your data is uploaded, switch on the **Treat as entity** setting for your Google Sheets connection. This indicates to Francis that the uploaded data represents accounting information. In response, Francis applies a series of transformations to present your data in a compliant format.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Categorize accounts">
    After enabling Treat as entity, Francis will prompt you to categorize each account as income, expense, asset, liability, or equity. This step ensures that Francis can automatically accumulate balance sheet accounts and correctly adjust values based on standard accounting conventions. Once categorized, Francis converts your data as follows:

    * **Income** accounts: Converted to positive (+) values.

    * **Expense** accounts: Converted to negative (-) values.

    * **Asset** accounts: Converted to positive (+) values.

    * **Liability** accounts: Converted to positive (+) values.

    * **Equity** accounts: Converted to positive (+) values.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Adjust consolidation setup (Optional)">
    If you’re already consolidating actuals across entities in Francis and want to incorporate accounting data imported from Google Sheets, you’ll need to adjust your existing setup to include this new data source.

    Open your consolidation template and select **Adjust split** from the action menu. Then, choose **Add new sheet** and drag the chip representing your newly added accounting data from the **Not yet assigned** group to the new sheet. Click **Apply** to confirm your changes. Your consolidation will now include an additional instance, reflecting the newly integrated Google Sheets data.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Syncing

Changes made in Google Sheets do not automatically sync to Francis. To reflect the latest updates in Francis, you must manually initiate a sync. If your data is not formatted correctly and does not meet the required data structure, the sync will fail, prompting you to correct the source data in Google Sheets before attempting again.
