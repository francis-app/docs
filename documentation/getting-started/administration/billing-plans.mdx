## Overview

### Plans

Your plan determines your monthly or annual billing rate and includes unlimited seats so your entire organization can collaborate at no extra cost. Refer to our [pricing page](https://www.francis.app/pricing) for the most up-to-date information on our plans offering.

### Billing cycles

You can choose either a monthly or annual billing cycle:

- **Monthly**: Billed in advance each month.
- **Annual**: Billed in advance each year at a 10% discount.

<Tip>
  Currently, only monthly plans can be purchased through self-service. Contact <a href="mailto:sales@francis.app">
  sales@francis.app</a>

   to subscribe to an annual plan and access discounted rates.
</Tip>

## Manage your billing

Navigate to **Settings \> Organization \> Billing** to access your plan information and make changes. From here, you can:

- View and change your plan
- Update your payment information
- Update the billing email
- View billing history, including past invoices and charges

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Upgrade">
    If you upgrade plans or billing cycle, we will immediately pro-rate the difference.

    Examples:

    1. If you upgrade from the monthly Core plan (\$149/month) to the monthly Advanced plan (\$399/month) halfway through your billing cycle, we'll credit the unused portion of your monthly Core subscription (\$75) and charge only the prorated amount (\$199) for the remainder of the month.
    2. If you upgrade from the monthly Core plan (\$149/month) to the annual Core plan (\$1,609/year) mid-cycle, we will credit the unused portion of your monthly subscription (\$75), reset your billing cycle, and charge the full annual amount (\$1,609) for the new billing period.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Downgrade">
    If you downgrade to a cheaper plan or switch to a shorter billing cycle, the change will take effect in the next billing cycle. Pre-paid subscriptions are non-refundable.

    Examples:

    1. If you downgrade from the monthly Advanced plan (\$399/month) to the monthly Core plan (\$149/month) mid-cycle, your Advanced plan will remain active until the end of the current billing cycle. It will then switch to the Core plan at the start of the next cycle.
    2. If you downgrade from the Annual Core plan (\$1,609/year) to the monthly Core plan (\$149/month) halfway through your billing cycle, the annual Core plan will run till the end of its billing cycle, the end of the year, and then convert to a monthly Core plan.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Cancel">
    Workspace owners and admins can cancel a subscription via **Settings \> Organization \> Plans**. Cancellations take effect at the end of the current billing cycle, with no refunds for mid-cycle cancellations.

    If you're unsure about committing to a full year, we recommend starting with a monthly plan. You can always switch to yearly later to enjoy discounted rates.

## Special pricing programs

### Partner program

If you work with multiple client workspaces in Francis, you may be eligible for our Partner Program. This program provides a discounted plan structure, priority support, and features that streamline financial planning across multiple organizations. Our discount options include:

- **50% discount** for workspaces where clients are not editors (internal use)
- **25% discount** for workspaces where clients collaborate as editors

You can manage all client subscriptions under your own account or allow clients to handle billing directly in their workspaces. Should you transfer workspace ownership to a client, that workspace reverts to standard plan pricing.
