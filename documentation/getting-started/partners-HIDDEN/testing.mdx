## Overview

With Francis, you create a separate organization for each client, each with its own access, billing, and data. You can invite colleagues and clients, apply advisor discounts, and reuse templates to speed up onboarding. We also offer demo setups with test data if you want to showcase Francis.

## Getting Started

### One organization per client

You should create a separate Francis organization for each client. Each organization can connect to multiple accounting systems, allowing you to support clients with several legal entities.

Switching between client organizations is easy and seamless inside Francis.

### User roles and access

When you or your colleagues join Francis, you’ll create users using your own email addresses. Once you’re a Certified Francis Advisor, your user profile will be tagged with an “Advisor” label based on the email domain.

The person who creates an organization automatically becomes its owner. Ownership can be transferred by contacting [support@francis.app](mailto:support@francis.app).

You can invite users to any organization with one of three roles: [admins, editors and viewers.](/documentation/getting-started/administration/members-roles)

<Info>
  There is no central admin panel to manage access across all organizations. You must invite each colleague into every client organization they should access.
</Info>

If someone should no longer have access, we recommend reviewing your organizations and removing them manually via the **Members page**.

### Inviting clients

You can also invite clients into their own organizations. Pricing depends on the level of access:

- Viewer-only access → 50% discount
- Admin/Editor access → 25% discount

Currently, it’s technically possible to assign clients Editor rights while using the 50% discount code. This setup is trust-based. We reserve the right to review access levels and adjust discounts if misaligned. for example, if Editor rights are granted while a 50% discount is applied.

### Subscription Management

Each client organization’s subscription is managed separately. You can select a different pricing plan for each client. See the available options [here](https://www.francis.app/pricing).

<Info>
  There is no central billing admin panel, so payments must be handled per organization.
</Info>

You can:

- Pay on behalf of the client by adding your card
- Invite the client to add their own payment details

In both cases, card information is added directly within the individual organization’s billing settings.

Each organization is invoiced separately, and the invoice will include the client’s organization name for reference.

### Advisor discounts

As a Certified Francis Advisor, you have access to two discount levels based on how actively the client uses Francis:

- Viewer-only access: 50%
- Editor/Admin access: 25%

The discount reflects client involvement: the more the client wants to use Francis directly (e.g. edit budgets), the higher the price. If you’re using Francis primarily as an internal tool to deliver work, the price is lower.

Once you become a Certified Francis Advisor, we’ll provide two promo codes, one for each tier, that you can apply during checkout.

### **Reusing Work with Templates**

One of the advantages of using Francis is the ability to reuse models across clients. You can either use Francis’ built-in financial model templates or create your own, which can be shared across client organizations.

This makes it easy to capture and scale your best practices. Advisors who build and reuse templates typically get clients up and running in under an hour.

You can promote any model you’ve built into a reusable template. To do so:

1. Duplicate the model you want to promote.
2. Remove any client-specific content, such as:
   1. Company names
   2. Employee names
   3. Confidential metrics or descriptions
3. Email [support@francis.app](mailto:support@francis.app) with the URL of the model you wish to promote (this includes the model ID we need to identify it).

We’ll then:

- Move the model to a dedicated, free organization called **“Template organization”**
- Promote it to a shared template
- Remove any data source mappings automatically

Once promoted, **any changes you make to the template are automatically published**. This ensures that new deployments always use the latest version.

### Demo data

If you want to demo Francis to potential clients, we can create a free demo organization for you with sample data. To get started, just email [support@francis.app](mailto:support@francis.app) and request a demo setup.

We’ll then:

1. Create a new demo organization under your account
2. Provide test data for two fictional entities - “Bakeries Inc” and “Webshop Ltd” - as Google Sheets, ready to be imported
3. Offer a short onboarding call to:
   - Set up a basic model
   - Configure Google Sheets connections
   - Map the data to a Francis template

This gives you a ready-to-use environment to showcase Francis without involving real client data.
