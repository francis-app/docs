## Basics

### Profile picture

By default, your avatar shows the first and last initials of your account name. If you signed up with a Google email address that has a public profile picture, Francis will automatically use that image as your avatar.

### Email address

Your email address in Francis is determined by the address you used when first creating your account. It serves as your unique ID for every organization you join or create. For example:

| **Action**                                                    | **Result**                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| You created an organization “Acme” using `jane.doe@email.com` | An account was created under `jane.doe@email.com`, and a user was simultaneously created for the Acme organization. |
| You’re invited to join another organization “Alpha”           | A user for `jane.doe@email.com` is created in the Alpha organization.                                               |

<Tip>
  If your company is changing domains and you'd like to change all emails in your organization, please reach out to us at [support@francis.app](mailto:support@francis.app) from the existing domain and let us know the domain you would like to change to.
</Tip>

### Name

Your full name appears to other members whenever they interact with your account. If you need to update your name, email [support@francis.app](mailto:support@francis.app), and our team will assist you.

### Leave your organization

To leave an organization where you have an active user profile, open **Settings \> Organization \> Members**, select the gear icon next to your name, and choose **Remove from organization...**. You’ll lose access to that workspace immediately, and an Owner or Admin would have to re-invite you if you need to return in the future.

<Tip>
  If you’re the only member remaining in an organization, you won’t be able to leave. Instead, you’ll need to delete the organization by going to **Settings \> Organization \> General** and selecting **Delete this organization**. This action is irreversible.
