## Overview

The Comments and Threads feature enables collaborative communication directly within your financial models. Users with workspace access can comment on specific cells, reply in threaded conversations, mention team members to notify them via email, and manage discussions through resolving, deleting, or marking threads as unread. With the comments overview, you can navigate, filter, and manage discussions, making your financial planning more collaborative and organized.

## Comments

### Post a comment

To add a comment:

1. Right-click on any cell in your model.
2. Select Comment from the drop-down menu.
3. Type your comment, then press Enter to post.

Comments are initially attached to the selected cell but can be repositioned by dragging the comment indicator to another cell as needed.

### Edit a comment

To edit an existing comment:

1. Hover your cursor over the comment, and click the three-dot (⋯) menu.
2. Select Edit from the drop-down options.
3. Update your comment and press Enter to save.

Edited comments will be marked with "(edited)" to clearly indicate to team members that the original context may have changed.

### Mentions

Mention colleagues directly within your comments to involve them in discussions:

- Type the `@` symbol followed by the team member’s name.
- They will receive an immediate email notification, prompting them to review and reply.

## Threads

Threads allow structured discussions around specific comments, helping your team maintain clarity in conversations.

### Resolve a thread

When a discussion or issue is concluded:

1. Open the thread and click the Resolve button.
2. The thread will be archived and visually removed from your model.

To view resolved threads later, select the Show resolved filter in the comments overview.

### Unresolve a thread

If additional discussion is necessary:

1. Open the resolved thread and select Unresolve from the action menu.
2. Francis automatically posts a system message: "Marked as unresolved" to indicate who reopened the discussion.

### Mark a thread unread

Some users prefer using unread threads as a task list for review:

1. Open the thread you want to mark as unread.
2. Click the three-dot (⋯) action menu in the top-right.
3. Select Mark as unread from the drop-down.

The thread closes automatically, reinstating its notification badge in the comments overview.

### Delete a thread

To permanently remove a thread:

1. Open the thread, select the action menu, then choose Delete thread.
2. Confirm deletion when prompted.

<Warning>
  This action is irreversible and permanently deletes the thread. Unless the thread contains sensitive information or was created by mistake, we recommend resolving instead of deleting, preserving context for future reference.
</Warning>

## Comments overview

The Comments overview provides a central location for reviewing active and historical comments across your model. By default, the overview displays unresolved comments from all sheets you can access, including those authored by your teammates.

### Filters and additional actions

To streamline your review process, Francis provides filtering capabilities in the comments overview:

- **Hide comments:** Temporarily hides comment indicators in your model to improve readability.
- **Show resolved:** Reveals previously resolved threads for historical context or additional review.
- **Only current sheet:** Only displays threads on the sheet you're currently viewing.
- **Only your threads:** Only displays threads you've initiated, allowing for focussed review.
