## Overview

Components are the fundamental building blocks of every financial model in Francis. Familiarizing yourself with the five components' use cases can significantly reduce the time spent on modeling. Understanding when to use rows instead of calculations or groups instead of sections will simplify structuring your model to align with other features in Francis.

## Basics

### Rows

Rows should feel familiar to users who have prior experience working with spreadsheets. Rows are used to create forecasts and follow up on actuals. You can create formulas in separate cells and map them to your general ledger to pull in actuals.

The important thing to note about rows is that you can link data from connected sources to any row in your model. By going to the [_Mappings_](/documentation/modeling/mappings) view in your model, you can map your general ledger accounts to rows in your model, allowing you to populate rows with actuals directly from your connected systems.

<Tip>
  Rows that include mappings will have a green connection indicator showing that they are connected to an external data source. Rows without mappings will show a gray indicator.
</Tip>

### Calculations

Calculations are used to perform time-consistent calculations, meaning that any numbers or formulas input into a calculation are the same across all periods in your model. Calculations are best used when a value is derived from values in other rows. The most common use cases for calculations are:

- Subtotals and margins
- Key performance indicators (KPIs)
- Cash flow statement calculations

<Tip>
  When modeling the cash flow statement, use calculations to make reference on your P&L and balance sheet to calculate cash movements for the period using the indirect method.
</Tip>

### Groups

Groups serve as containers for rows and calculations and are typically used to define the structure of sections. By default, groups automatically sum the values of rows and calculations contained within. Commonly grouped line items include:

- Revenue streams
- Direct costs
- OPEX
- Assets
- Liabilities
- Equity

<Tip>
  When possible, reference groups instead of rows or calculations. Groups will automatically capture the addition of new rows or calculations, eliminating the need for manual updates to cell references as you continue to expand your model.
</Tip>

### Sections

Sections allow you to define the layout of your model and won't impact numbers or calculations. Sections can contain groups, rows, and calculations. How many sections you want to split your model into is up to you. Common sections include:

- Profit and loss
- Balance sheet
- Cash flow
- Revenue forecasts
- Assumptions or drivers

<Tip>
  Consider your desired reporting format before structuring your model, as PDF reports are generated by selecting which sections to include.
</Tip>

### Sheets

Sheets allow you to separate your model into multiple sheets. Their behavior is similar to that of tabs in other spreadsheets, and you can easily make [formula](/documentation/modeling/formulas) references across sheets.

<Tip>
  Drag and drop components across sheets to reorganize your model. Francis' [formula syntax](/documentation/features/modeling/formula) ensures that components can easily change position without breaking references.
