## Overview

Like Excel and Sheets, Francis' formulas use cell references, [functions](/documentation/modeling/functions), and mathematical operators. However, Francis uses a slightly different, more human-readable syntax than the A1 notation found in other spreadsheets.

## Basics

### Syntax

Francis's formulas follow the syntax `"ROW_NAME"[RELATIVE_PERIOD]`. For example, to reference the value of the row "Revenue" from 12 months earlier you would input the following:

```typescript
="Revenue"[-12]
```

There are several reasons for why we've implemented this syntax:

* More readable references and syntax, with clearly stated names and relative periods

* Syntax allows users to drag and drop components without breaking references

* Simplified rolling forecasts, as all references are based on relative periods

### Comments

Inspired by programming best practices, you can insert comments directly into your formulas to add context where it matters most. Simply place a hashtag (#) at the end of your formula, and any text that follows is highlighted in green. This makes it easier to interpret complex logic by keeping context alongside the formula itself.

```python
= IF("Revenue"[0]=0,0,"Direct costs"[0]/"Revenue"[0])
# Function returns zero if revenue is zero to avoid dividing with zero
```

### Conventions

The convention in Francis is that income and balance sheet items are input as positive values (+), while expenses are input as negative values (-). This ensures compatibility with imported actuals from connected accounting systems.

Consequently, subtotals like gross profit will be calculated by taking revenue and *adding* direct costs using a plus (+), instead of subtracting direct costs using a minus (-). In simpler terms, gross profit would be calculated as:

```typescript
="Revenue"[0] + "DirectÂ costs"[0]
```
